Required setup before running application:

Download Anaconda from here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

Go to terminal and paste the following code:

====

conda create --name my_env python=3
conda activate my_env
conda install -c conda-forge spleeter

====

This will set up a virtual environment in Anaconda called "myenv" and install spleeter on it.

Now you can run the application.
