# Spleet-It
MacOS GUI application for spleeter audio-processing library.

## Instructions

Download Anaconda from here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

Go to terminal and paste the following code:

`conda create --name my_env python=3`
`conda activate my_env`
`conda install -c conda-forge spleeter`

This will set up a virtual environment in Anaconda called "myenv" and install spleeter on it.

Now you can run the application.
